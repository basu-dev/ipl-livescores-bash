# Ipl Live Score on Bash And I3blocks
It is intended for any terminal running bash or sh. Watch live IPL Scores live on the terminal and it will be sugar on the butter if you use i3wm and i3blocks. Because I have configured it to be compatible to i3blocks.. You can use it any way you can by just few lines of code.

It shows the latest match as menu and you need to select a match to see watch it. You need to install rofi for this.
